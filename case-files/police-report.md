## INCIDENT SUMMARY

At approximately 20:45, TechCorp security discovered the theft of an NVIDIA RTX 9090 TITAN ULTRA prototype GPU valued at $2.5 million during their evening security check. The device was stolen from a biometric-secured vault during the annual TechCorp Innovation Auction. The theft occurred between 18:30 (when the vault was sealed after final demonstration) and 20:45 (discovery time). All 200+ auction attendees and 50+ staff members remain detained in the building under lockdown protocol.

## INITIAL INVESTIGATION FINDINGS

CCTV review of 6+ hours of footage shows no unauthorized personnel entering the vault area, and all access logs confirm only authorized entries. Metal detectors at all exits show no large items were removed from the building. The vault's biometric lock shows no signs of tampering, and the GPU was cleanly removed from its mounting system without damage. All obvious hiding locations (storage rooms, offices, bathrooms) have been searched without success. The perpetrator demonstrated insider knowledge and professional-level technical skills.

## CONCLUSION AND STATUS

**The stolen GPU remains inside the TechCorp building.** The thief had authorized access and sophisticated knowledge of security systems. Standard hiding locations have been eliminated. Building remains under lockdown pending detailed forensic examination. **CRITICAL:** The GPU contains a self-destruct mechanism with 72-hour countdown already activated. Recovery is time-sensitive.

**Investigation Status:** Ongoing - Detailed evidence collection in progress  
**Next Steps:** Forensic analysis of demonstration areas and technical equipment
